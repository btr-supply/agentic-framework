# CLAUDE.md - Internal Documentation

This file contains instructions for Claude (AI) when working on this repository.

## Critical Rules

### NO AI/Agentic Authoring Attribution

**NEVER embed AI or agentic authoring attribution in:**
- Commit messages
- Code comments
- Documentation
- README files
- Any repository files

Examples of FORBIDDEN content:
- ❌ "🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
- ❌ "Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5"
- ❌ "AI-generated content"
- ❌ Any mention of AI assistance in commits/docs

**Why:** This is a professional repository. Attribution should reflect human contributors only.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, professional commit messages without AI attribution:

```
feat: Add hub-and-spoke orchestration model

- Implement Sibyl as central orchestrator
- Add reporting chains for all agents
- Update documentation
```

## Code Standards

Follow existing code style and conventions. Add comments only when logic is non-obvious. Never add comments mentioning AI assistance.

## Documentation

Documentation should be clear, concise, and professional. No AI attribution.
