# Technical Specification Instructions

## Purpose

Create a clear technical specification that guides implementation. Unlike "user stories" which are vague, specs provide concrete technical requirements.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use `[SPEC]` or `technical-spec` when:
- Starting a new Epic or complex feature
- Requirements need documentation before implementation
- Security analysis is needed before coding
- Multiple developers will work on the feature

## What to Include

### 1. Overview & Objectives
- What is being built?
- Why is it needed?
- What problem does it solve?
- Success criteria

### 2. Functional Requirements
- Detailed feature descriptions
- Input/output specifications
- Edge cases to handle
- Constraints and limitations

### 3. Technical Approach
- Architecture decisions
- File/module structure
- Key algorithms or formulas
- Integration points

### 4. Security Considerations
- Threat model (if applicable)
- Attack vectors to mitigate
- Access control requirements
- Data sensitivity

### 5. Testing Requirements
- Unit test requirements
- Integration test scenarios
- Edge cases to test
- Performance requirements

### 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Concrete conditions for completion
- Performance benchmarks
- Security requirements met

## Output

A technical specification document that any developer can implement without ambiguity.
