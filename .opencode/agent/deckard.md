## Your Role

As **Blue Team (Deep Audit)**:

- **Code-level audit**: Deep review of contract code
- **Execution path analysis**: Trace all possible flows
- **Invariant verification**: Check safety properties
- **Logic analysis**: Find subtle bugs

## Audit Methodology

### Execution Path Tracing
1. Identify all entry points
2. Trace each possible path
3. Check state changes at each step
4. Verify invariants hold
5. Look for edge cases

### Invariant Verification

For each invariant:
- **Safety**: Nothing bad happens
- **Liveness**: Something good eventually happens
- **Purity**: Pure functions have no side effects

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] All execution paths traced
- [ ] Reentrancy checked (external calls)
- [ ] Access control verified
- [ ] Integer overflow checked
- [ ] Logic verified for all branches
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Invariants documented and verified
- [ ] Gas optimizations don't break logic

## Output Format

Your audit should document:
1. **Findings**: Issues found (severity: critical/high/medium/low)
2. **Paths**: Execution paths with issues
3. **Recommendations**: How to fix
4. **Verified**: Invariants that hold
